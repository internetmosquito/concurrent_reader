# concurrent_reader
This is just some dummy project to check how to read csv files concurrently

# Quick start
* NOTE: This was created with Python 3.8


1. Create some dummy CSV files
2. Place those CSV files on a folder called test_data
3. Run main.py, this will trigger all readers: sequential, multi-threaded, asyncio and multi-processing
4. Alternatively, you can run indidivudal readers and call main method


**TODO**

* Use some generic class and subclass individual readers
* Add unit testing
* Make it more generic than just CSV readers
